    A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, most calculators will add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Some also do square roots, and more complex calculators can help with calculus and draw function graphs. Calculators are found everywhere. A smartphone or other computer can also act as a calculator.

Some calculators, like the abacus, will work without electricity. Others, like the electronic calculator, use batteries. Some calculators are simple, and can only add, subtract, multiply and divide, and sometimes take square roots. Scientific calculators can do many other things, such as use exponents (or powers or indices) and trigonometry functions.


Advantages:
This technology allows students solve complicated problems quickly and in an efficient manner. Additionally, it can reduce the problem to simpler tasks and allows the student to devote more time in understanding the problem. Secondly, they are saved from monotonous calculations and the same boring mundane procedure.

Disadvantages:

The Calculator is available in variety of brands, and each brand and model requires a specific set of instructions. It is a proven fact that many of us do not bother to read these manual, and it gets lost. Although the instructions are quite simple, there are chances that students might make mistake. A small mistake is sufficient to lead to the wrong answer. A student must have the ability of estimating the correct answers or the student would not cross check the problem. It is in the best interest of students to repeat all the mathematical calculation once. Alternatively, if there is difference in answers between the first and second calculation, the student must repeat the operations again.
